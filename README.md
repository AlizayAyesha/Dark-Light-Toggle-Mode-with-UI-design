# Dark-Light-Toggle-Mode-with-UI-design
This project demonstrates how to implement a Dark Mode and Light Mode toggle feature with a user-friendly UI design.

## Features:
### Dark Mode and Light Mode:
Users can switch between dark and light color schemes.
### User Interface Design: 
The toggle button and UI elements adjust their appearance based on the selected mode.
### Persistent Mode Selection:
The selected mode preference is stored and applied across sessions (using local storage).
### Easy Toggle Functionality: 
Clicking the toggle button instantly switches between modes.
## How It Works:
### Toggle Button: 
Clicking the toggle button switches between dark and light modes.
### CSS Changes: 
jQuery updates CSS classes or directly manipulates CSS properties to change colors, backgrounds, etc., based on the selected mode.
### Local Storage:
Stores the current mode preference locally, ensuring the selected mode persists when the page is refreshed.
## Usage:
Clone or download the repository.
Open index.html in a web browser.
Use the toggle button to switch between Dark Mode and Light Mode.
Observe the UI elements and overall page design adjust according to the selected mode.
## Technologies Used:
- HTML5
- CSS3 (including CSS variables for color themes)
- jQuery
## Structure:
### index.html:
Contains the HTML structure and the toggle button for mode switching.
### style.css:
Defines styles for UI elements, including dark and light mode CSS variables.
### script.js: 
Implements the jQuery logic to handle toggle button events and apply dark/light mode styles.
